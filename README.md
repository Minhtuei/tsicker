## About The Project 🔎
This project is an idea behind the combination about converting cartoon image and uploading post. The design is mostly inspired from pinterest and cartoonize.
Another interesting combination is ultilizing the benefits of machine learning languages (python) and web languages (javascript) make them become more relevant.
All the pretrained AI models are given by some repos in github such as [CartoonGAN](https://github.com/Yijunmaverick/CartoonGAN-Test-Pytorch-Torch) or [here](https://github.com/pythonlessons/background_removal)
and converted into single AWS lambda function.
